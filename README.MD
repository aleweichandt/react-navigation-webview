## Documentation


## React Navigation Useful Docs

* The best way to learn is to follow the [Getting started guide](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started.html). It guides you through the fundamentals of React Navigation.
* The documentation includes solutions for common use cases in the "How do I do ...?" section, such as [tab navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/tab-based-navigation.html) and [Redux integration](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/redux-integration.html).
* If you need to build your own navigator, [there's a section for that](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/custom-navigator-overview.html) too.
* The [API reference](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/api-reference.html) lists all public APIs.
* The [Community Resources](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/blob/master/COMMUNITY_RESOURCES.md) document lists some other resources submitted to us by people who use React Navigation. Feel free to open a pull request to add your resource to the list.
* You can contribute improvements to the documentation [in the website repository](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation.github.io).
